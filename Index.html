            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>George H. W. Bush served his country in many roles—war hero, diplomat, director of the CIA, and eventually, President. Known for his humility, strength, and dedication, Bush guided America through significant moments in world history with calm leadership. <br>


                He was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts. At just 18 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II, becoming one of the youngest naval aviators. After being shot down over the Pacific and rescued by a U.S. submarine, Bush returned home as a decorated hero. <br>

                
                Following the war, he attended Yale University, started a family, and moved to Texas to build a career in the oil industry. But his heart was always drawn to public service. He was elected to Congress in 1966, later serving as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Envoy to China, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Director of the CIA. <br>

                
                In 1980, he became Vice President under Ronald Reagan, and in 1988, he was elected the 41st President of the United States. His presidency was marked by major global events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, and the successful Gulf War campaign to liberate Kuwait. <br>

                
                He also championed domestic issues, signing the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark civil rights law, and promoting volunteerism through his “Thousand Points of Light” initiative. <br>

                
                After leaving office, he continued to serve by supporting humanitarian causes and partnering with former political rivals, including Bill Clinton, for disaster relief efforts. Through it all, he remained a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and man of deep faith and quiet generosity.</p>
